## 🎮 Player Leaderboard Sorter (DSA Project)
- This project is a Python implementation of a linked list with QuickSort from scratch.  
- It sorts a leaderboard of players based on either their scores or names in ascending or descending order.

## 👨‍💻 Contribution
- **Linked List Implementation**: Created a custom linked list class with insert and utility methods.
- **QuickSort Algorithm**: Implemented QuickSort recursively to sort the linked list by numeric score or player name.
- **User Input Handling**: Added functionality to accept dynamic input for player names and scores.
- **Sorting Options**: Provided options for ascending/descending order and sort by score or name.
- **Leaderboard Display**: Displayed sorted leaderboard with formatted output.

My teanmate and I collaborated on testing, debugging, and finalizing the code to make sure everything works in order.

## 🧰 Technologies & Concepts Used
- Python
- Data Structures: Linked List
- Algorithms: QuickSort (custom implementation)
- OOP Concepts: Classes, Objects, and Methods
- Input Validation and Error Handling

## 📜 Project Summary
This project demonstrates fundamental data structure and algorithm skills including:
- Creating and managing a **linked list** from scratch
- Implementing **QuickSort** on a non-array data structure
- Handling dynamic user input with validation
- Sorting by multiple criteria (numeric and string fields)
- Displaying a formatted leaderboard

## 🏁 Outcome
Through this project, I strengthened my knowledge of:
- **Linked List Operations** – inserting, traversing, and converting to arrays for display
- **Algorithm Implementation** – understanding QuickSort logic and adapting it for linked lists
- **Problem Solving & Debugging** – validating input, managing pointers, and handling edge cases
- **Python OOP** – designing classes with encapsulated methods for modular code
- **User Interaction** – building a simple console-based interactive application
